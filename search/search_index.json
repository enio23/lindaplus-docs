Workflow LINDA+ is a method used to identify intra- and inter-cellular interaction networks at a domain resolution, allowing to further study the effects of Alternative Splicing (AS) on signalling. It is a tool that integrates large-scale knowledge of directed joint interactions (protein-protein and Domain-Domain intra-cellular interactions) as well as structurally resolved ligand-receptor pairs from various resources with estimated transcription factor enzymatic activities based on sc-RNAseq reads (see Figure 1. ). Figure 1: LINDA+ Pipeline At the core of LINDA+ stands an optimization problem, formulated as an Integer Linear Programming (ILP), which allows for joint mechanistic analysis of inter- and intra-cellular protein interaction networks based on scRNAseq data. Dependencies Resources LINDA+ relies the following resources for performing it's analysis: Resources of protein interactions at a domain resolution level: By default, LINDA+ uses DIGGER as a resource of joint Protein-Protein (PPI) and Domain-Domain (DDI) interactions in human. This allows LINDA+ to mechanistically characterize effects that post-transcriptional processes, such as alternative splicing, might have on protein interaction networks. Resources of ligand-receptor pairs: Several ligand-receptor interaction resources have been integrated in LINDA+, including: CellChat , CellPhoneDB , CellTalkDB and LIANA . For LINDA+, we have additionally annotated extracellular domains of the receptors, through which the ligands would be able to interact. Resources of transcription factors (TF) to gene relations: LINDA+ additionally relies on known tf-to-gene relations in order to: i) Determine significantly regulated TF's based on gene-expression values for each cell-type; and ii) Identifying what kinds of ligand genes do these TF's regulate and which can then be secreted into the extra-cellular space. Two types of human tf-to-gene resources have been integrated in LINDA+: DoRothEA and TfLink . All of the above resources have been integrated in the LINDA+ R-package and details about how combinations of each type of resource can be used for a real-case application of LINDA+ can be found in the Tutorials (hyperlinked once tutorials have been added). Users can of course use their own resources of molecular interactions for as long as they are provided in a format recognizable by LINDA+ (see details here (hyperlink to be added later)). Additionally we provide prior knowledge of interactions tailored specifically towards contextualizing molecular interaction networks in a cardiobiology context (details here (to be added when ready)). For this purpose we have utilized prompt-based data mining of Large Language Models (LLM's), to enhance our biomedical knowledge resources based on a collection 1015 molecular cardiology related manuscripts (see details here (hyperlink to be added later)). Solver LINDA+ requires the interactive version of IBM Cplex as an ILP problem optimiser. The IBM ILOG Cplex is freely available through Academic Initiative . Details about how to obtain the free full license under the Academic Initiative have been provided here . Once the CPLEX solver has been acquired by the user, they must save the executable files in any desired location in the machine they are using and then they can run. Then, thy should make the acquired cplex solver executable, but running the following (in MAC/Unix systems): chmod +x cplex . Finally, you can perform the LINDA+ analyses after specifying the path to the executable file (through the solverPath parameter, see examples below). Installation Once the required solvers have been obtained and the mentioned R-package depedencies have been installed, then the users can proceed with the installation of LINDA. Currently users can install LINDA+ either through GitHub or directly from the source after downloading the source (tar file) and typing one of the following in the R command line: directly from GitHub: devtools::install_github(\"dieterich-lab/LINDAPlus\", build_vignettes = FALSE) or from source: devtools::install_local(path = \"path_to_extracted_LINDAPlus_directory\", build_manual = TRUE, build_vignettes = FALSE, force = TRUE) NOTE: If you wish for the the Vignettes to be built and for the test example to run successfully, please put the cplex executable file under the /Downloads/ directory and only then you can set build_vignettes = TRUE . In the case when building the vignettes is not possible, you can access it here .

Resources access LINDA+ functionalities The LINDA+ R-package implements two functions: i) prepare_linda_inputs() , which prepares the list of interaction tables that are used for the network inference; as well as ii) runLINDAPlus() , which is the main function of the package that is used to infer the regulatory inter- and intra- cellular protein interactions. prepare_linda_inputs() Before performing any types of network inference analysis, users should first generate the background.networks.list object that is taken as an input from the runLINDAPlus() functionality by using the prepare_linda_inputs() function. Besides generating the background.networks.list , the prepare_linda_inputs() can also optionally perform some processing of the provided interactions. Such processing steps consist in defining for example which genes to keep or to remove for each of the cell-types in their prior knowledge of interactions. For example, one instance when such processing step would be recommended is for the case when some genes might not be expressed in any given cell-type and thus this functionality would allow the users to remove protein nodes from the solution whose corresponding genes have not been expressed. In case when such a functionality is used, below is provided a description of the inputs that can be provided to such a function. interactions_df : A data-frame of all possible interactions (PPI/DDI, Ligand-Receptors and TF-to-Ligand) that will be used for the network inference analysis. The format of such an input should be the same as the ones described above . cell_types : Names of the cell-types. Note: Do not assign the 'LR' name to any of the cell-types as this is reserved by LINDA+ for it's internal network inference analysis. genes2keep : An optional named list object (same as 'cell_types') of character vectors defining the list of gene-names to keep in the interaction knowledge provided in the 'interactions_df'. By default, genes2keep=NULL , in which case no processing will be applied to the 'interactions_df' object. genes2remove : A named list object (same as 'cell_types') of character vectors defining the list of gene-names to keep in the interaction knowledge provided in the 'interactions_df'. By default, genes2remove=NULL , in which case no processing will be applied to the 'interactions_df' object. ligands : A character vector, indicating the names of the ligands that the user wishes to consider for the network inference analysis. By default, ligands=NULL , in which case ligands will be considered all the elements defined as such based on the structure of the 'interactions_df' object (see details above ). receptors : A character vector, indicating the names of the receptors that the user wishes to consider for the network inference analysis. By default, receptors=NULL , in which case receptors will be considered all the elements defined as such based on the structure of the 'interactions_df' object (see details above ). runLINDAPlus() The main function in LINDA+ that is used to perform the network inference analysis is runLINDAPlus() and which can take the following inputs: Mandatory Inputs: background.networks.list : The list consists of two elements: a) background.networks : This should be a named (cell-types) list containing data-frames joint PPI-DDI's for each cell-type. Each data-frame represents the set of interaction knowledge for each cell-type and it should contain at least 4 columns with the following ID's: 'pfam_source', 'pfam_target', gene_source' and 'gene_target'. In the case where we have no name for a specific domain or where this is not applicable, please set the corresponding values in the 'pfam_source' or 'pfam_target' as NA's (for more details, see in the examples); and b) ligand.receptors : This also should be a named list ('ligands' and 'receptors') which contains character vectors where the set of elements that corresponds to Ligands and Receptors have been defined as such. tf.scores : This information should be provided as a named list (for each cell-type) and which contains data-frames indicating the enrichment scores for each TF at each cell-type. The data-frames should contain at least two columns: 'tf' (indicating the TF ID) and the numerical 'score' (indicating the enrichment scores for each TF). Optional Inputs: lr.scores : This information can be provided as a named list (for each cell-type) and which contains data-frames indicating scores that can be assigned to each ligand-receptor interactions targeting a specific cell. The scores should be provided from 0 to 1. The higher the score assigned to a ligand-receptor interaction, the more likely it is for it to be present in the network solution, while in the case of a score of 0, this will force LINDA+ to not include such an interaction in the solution for a specific indicated cell-type. ligand.scores : A data-frame object which should contain two columns: 'ligands' (providing the ligand ID's) and 'score' (providing the score associated to each ligand, i.e. abundance). The scores should be provided either 0 or 1 and the higher the score of the ligand, the more likely it will be for a ligand to appear in the solution. A score of 0, means that this ligand will not be able to perturb any receptor of any cell-type. ccc.scores : A data-frame object which should contain two columns: 'ccc' (providing pairs of interacting cell-types, i.e. \"CellA=CellB\" for the case when CellA communicates with CellB ) and 'score' (providing the score associated to each communicating cell pair). The scores should be provided between 0 and 1 and the higher the score a cell-cell interaction, the more likely it will be for the source cell-type to communicate to the target cell-type. A score of 0, means that the defined source cell-type will not talk to the defined target cell-type. as.input : A data-frame object which should contain four columns: 'cell_type' (defining the cell-type in which the splicing effect is happening), 'proteinID' (defining the name of the protein affected by splicing), 'domainID' (defining the PFAM identifier of the protein domain that has been affected by splicing) and 'effect' (defining the type of effect that the alternative splicing has on this specific domain: either exclusion or inclusion ). In the case of exclusion effect, the corresponding domain will be conidered as skipped and not involved in any of the domain interactions. In the case of inclusion , the defined domain will be present in the solution as an interactor. solverPath : Here is provided the location path to the desired solver. By default, the path to the cplex solver is set to: solverPath = \"/usr/bin/cplex\" . top.tf : A named numerical vector defining how many TF's should be considered as significantly enriched for each of the tables provided in the tf.scores input. The names of the elements in the vector should correspond to the desired cell-types. By default, top.tf = NULL , in which case all the TF's given in the tf.scores list across each cell-type willbe considered as significantly enriched. lambda1 : A numerical value representing the penalization term of the primary objective of the objective function - TF inclusion. This penalty factor is suggested to be set to a higher value compared to other penalty parameters in order to strongly penalize the inclusion of not signifcantly regulated TF's. By default, lambda1=10 . lambda2 : A numerical value representing the penalization term of the ligands nodes in the network solution. It is only used when ligand.scores data-frame object is provided. In this case, by default (when not specified), lambda2=15 . lambda3 : A numerical value representing the penalization term of the ligand-receptor interactions in the network solution. It is only used when lr.scores or ccc.scores or both have been provided. In this case, by default (when not specified), lambda3=1 . lambda4 : A numerical value representing the penalization term of the network components in the solution (proteins and domains). By default, lambda4=0.1 . mipgap : CPLEX parameter which sets an absolute tolerance on the gap between the best integer objective and the objective of the best node remaining. When this difference falls below the value of this parameter, the mixed integer optimization is stopped. By default, mipgap=0 . relgap : CPLEX parameter which sets a relative tolerance on the objective value for the solutions in the solution pool. Solutions that are worse (either greater in the case of a minimization, or less in the case of a maximization) than the incumbent solution by this measure are not kept in the solution pool. For example, if relgap=0.001 (or 0.1 percent), meaning that then solutions worse than the incumbent by 0.1 percent or more will be discarded. By default, relgap=0 . populate : CPLEX parameter which sets the maximum number of mixed integer programming (MIP) solutions generated for the solution pool during each call to the populate procedure. Populate stops when it has generated the amount of solutions set in this parameter. By default, populate=500 . nSolutions : The number of solutions to be provided by LINDA+. By default, nSolutions=100 . timelimit : CPLEX parameter which sets the maximum optimization time in seconds. By default, timelimit=3600 . intensity : CPLEX parameter which controls the trade-off between the number of solutions generated for the solution pool and the amount of time or memory consumed. Values from 1 to 4 invoke increasing effort to find larger numbers of solutions. Higher values are more expensive in terms of time and memory but are likely to yield more solutions. By default, intensity=1 . replace : CPLEX parameter which designates the strategy for replacing a solution in the solution pool when the solution pool has reached its capacity. The value 0 replaces solutions according to a first-in, first-out policy. The value 1 keeps the solutions with the best objective values. The value 2 replaces solutions in order to build a set of diverse solutions. By default, replace=1 . threads : CPLEX parameter which manage the number of threads that CPLEX uses. By default, threads=0 (let CPLEX decide). The number of threads that CPLEX uses is no more than the number of CPU cores available on the computer where CPLEX is running. condition : A parameter which can be used in the case when LINDA is desirde to run over multiple analyses in parallel. It is useful to distinguish between the multiple ILP problems defined for each case as well as the solutions obtained. By default, conditions=1 . save_res : A TRUE/FALSE parameter defining whether you would like to save the results as an .RData object. If save_res = TRUE , a 'res_condition.RData' (depending on the value set to condition ) will be saved in the local working direcotry. By default, save_res=FALSE .

By default, relgap=0 . populate : CPLEX parameter which sets the maximum number of mixed integer programming (MIP) solutions generated for the solution pool during each call to the populate procedure. Populate stops when it has generated the amount of solutions set in this parameter. By default, populate=500 . nSolutions : The number of solutions to be provided by LINDA+. By default, nSolutions=100 . timelimit : CPLEX parameter which sets the maximum optimization time in seconds. By default, timelimit=3600 . intensity : CPLEX parameter which controls the trade-off between the number of solutions generated for the solution pool and the amount of time or memory consumed. Values from 1 to 4 invoke increasing effort to find larger numbers of solutions. Higher values are more expensive in terms of time and memory but are likely to yield more solutions. By default, intensity=1 . replace : CPLEX parameter which designates the strategy for replacing a solution in the solution pool when the solution pool has reached its capacity. The value 0 replaces solutions according to a first-in, first-out policy. The value 1 keeps the solutions with the best objective values. The value 2 replaces solutions in order to build a set of diverse solutions. By default, replace=1 . threads : CPLEX parameter which manage the number of threads that CPLEX uses. By default, threads=0 (let CPLEX decide). The number of threads that CPLEX uses is no more than the number of CPU cores available on the computer where CPLEX is running. condition : A parameter which can be used in the case when LINDA is desirde to run over multiple analyses in parallel. It is useful to distinguish between the multiple ILP problems defined for each case as well as the solutions obtained. By default, conditions=1 . save_res : A TRUE/FALSE parameter defining whether you would like to save the results as an .RData object. If save_res = TRUE , a 'res_condition.RData' (depending on the value set to condition ) will be saved in the local working direcotry. By default, save_res=FALSE .","title":"runLINDAPlus()"},{"location":"documentation/#understaning-output","text":"","title":"Understaning Output"},{"location":"download/","text":"Ut accepto bella secretaque viroque ducat admonitu Namque unde udaeque absens Lorem markdownum quod e templum vocem ver!

We start by first describing the inputs that are to be given for a LINDA+ analysis, followed by tutorial examples of each feature on a small Toy example to then follow with a real-case application. Inputs The main function in LINDA+ that is used to perform the network inference analysis is runLINDAPlus() and which can take the following inputs: Mandatory Inputs: background.networks.list : The list consists of two elements: a) background.networks : This should be a named (cell-types) list containing data-frames joint PPI-DDI's for each cell-type. Each data-frame represents the set of interaction knowledge for each cell-type and it should contain at least 4 columns with the following ID's: 'pfam_source', 'pfam_target', gene_source' and 'gene_target'. In the case where we have no name for a specific domain or where this is not applicable, please set the corresponding values in the 'pfam_source' or 'pfam_target' as NA's (for more details, see in the examples); and b) ligand.receptors : This also should be a named list ('ligands' and 'receptors') which contains character vectors where the set of elements that corresponds to Ligands and Receptors have been defined as such. tf.scores : This information should be provided as a named list (for each cell-type) and which contains data-frames indicating the enrichment scores for each TF at each cell-type. The data-frames should contain at least two columns: 'tf' (indicating the TF ID) and the numerical 'score' (indicating the enrichment scores for each TF). Optional Inputs: lr.scores : This information can be provided as a named list (for each cell-type) and which contains data-frames indicating scores that can be assigned to each ligand-receptor interactions targeting a specific cell. The scores should be provided from 0 to 1. The higher the score assigned to a ligand-receptor interaction, the more likely it is for it to be present in the network solution, while in the case of a score of 0, this will force LINDA+ to not include such an interaction in the solution for a specific indicated cell-type. ligand.scores : A data-frame object which should contain two columns: 'ligands' (providing the ligand ID's) and 'score' (providing the score associated to each ligand, i.e. abundance). The scores should be provided between 0 and 1 and the higher the score of the ligand, the more likely it will be for a ligand to appear in the solution. A score of 0, means that this ligand will not be able to perturb any receptor of any cell-type. ccc.scores : A data-frame object which should contain two columns: 'ccc' (providing pairs of interacting cell-types, i.e. \"CellA=CellB\" for the case when CellA communicates with CellB ) and 'score' (providing the score associated to each communicating cell pair). The scores should be provided between 0 and 1 and the higher the score a cell-cell interaction, the more likely it will be for the source cell-type to communicate to the target cell-type. A score of 0, means that the defined source cell-type will not talk to the defined target cell-type. as.input : A data-frame object which should contain four columns: 'cell_type' (defining the cell-type in which the splicing effect is happening), 'proteinID' (defining the name of the protein affected by splicing), 'domainID' (defining the PFAM identifier of the protein domain that has been affected by splicing) and 'effect' (defining the type of effect that the alternative splicing has on this specific domain: either exclusion or inclusion ). In the case of exclusion effect, the corresponding domain will be conidered as skipped and not involved in any of the domain interactions. In the case of inclusion , the defined domain will be present in the solution as an interactor. solverPath : Here is provided the location path to the desired solver. By default, the path to the cplex solver is set to: solverPath = \"/usr/bin/cplex\" . top.tf : A named numerical vector defining how many TF's should be considered as significantly enriched for each of the tables provided in the tf.scores input. The names of the elements in the vector should correspond to the desired cell-types. By default, top.tf = NULL , in which case all the TF's given in the tf.scores list across each cell-type willbe considered as significantly enriched. lambda1 :","title":"Tutorials"},{"location":"tutorial/#tutorials","text":"Here are provided tutorials about how to use LINDA+ R-package in it's basic form as well as all of it's implemented features.
