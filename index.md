# LLINDA+

This is the documentation page of the LINDA+ software.

LINDA+ is a method used to identify intra- and inter-cellular interaction 
networks at a domain resolution, allowing to further study the effects of 
Alternative Splicing (AS) on signalling. It is a tool that integrates 
large-scale knowledge of directed joint interactions (protein-protein and 
Domain-Domain intra-cellular interactions) as well as structurally resolved 
ligand-receptor pairs from various resources (list of resources when ready) with 
estimated transcription factor enzymatic activities based on sc-RNAseq reads and 
optionally abundances of secreted extra-cellular proteins from Secretomics data 
analysis.
